# An EDA tool for analogue IC design

During my MS studies, I developed an electronic design automation tool named JPAD for designing and simulating analogue IC circuits. The program was purely developed in Java. The source code of this tool can be found in the source directory of this repository.

**Licence:** Note that the code can be changed and reused as long as you keep the copyright inside and at the beginning of every Java file in the source directory unchanged. If this tool is used in research project, it should be cited as "Alireza Poshtkohi, A Java-based EDA tool for analogue integrated circuit design, <https://github.com/poshtkohi/jpad>".

Two snapshots of the program are shown below
